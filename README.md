### Me 😉
Ayush Yadav, aka CLAW, from India here! 
I love Linux (I would like to interject fo....).
And I love developing softwares for it too.

## ??? 🔷
- I use Arch BTW!
- Always been learning C/C++ (no one can truly expertise in them completely)
- Developing my own Kernel

### My Works 🔧
- [Discitix Kernel](https://github.com/ayush7788/discitix_kernel)
- [Simple Command Helper](https://github.com/ayush7788/sch)
- [Universal Package Manager](https://github.com/ayush7788/upm)
- [Encoder](https://github.com/ayush7788/encoder)
- [Arch Install Script](https://github.com/ayush7788/ayush7788/blob/main/arch_install.sh]

Please do note that my script is only for UEFI systems!
Also it doesn't make partitions on its own! So please make your partitions before running script!
It currently only supports ext4, if you want to use any other filesystem, please format partitions with your choice of FileSystem and 
choose "no" when asked to format as ext4 in script.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayush7788/ayush7788/main/arch_install.sh
chmod +x arch_install.sh
./arch_install.sh
```
